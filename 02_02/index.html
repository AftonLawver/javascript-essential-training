    /* Always load javascript files in the head tag.
    Always use either async or defer to control when
    the javascript is loaded.
    Async: it will download the javascript file while
    the browser parses through the html document and
    it will only pause the browser rendering when it executes
    the javascript.
    Defer: downloads the javascript file while
    parsing through the html document, and then
    executes it after entire html document is read.
